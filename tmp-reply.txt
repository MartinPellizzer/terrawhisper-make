### 2. Core Teaching  
Let me break it down into 3 steps:

**Step 1: Choose a Fresh Herb for Your Desired Remedy**  
The first and most important step is selecting the right herb for your specific need. For example, if you're looking to support digestion, you might choose ginger or fennel. If you're dealing with anxiety, valerian root or passionflower could be ideal. Always look for fresh, high-quality herbs—preferably organic—to ensure potency and safety. A case study from a herbalist in Oregon showed that using fresh herbs in tinctures resulted in a 40% improvement in user outcomes compared to dried herbs.

**Step 2: Rinse the Herbs Under Cold Water to Remove Dirt**  
Before you even touch the herb, it’s important to clean it thoroughly. Use cold water to gently rinse away any dirt, insects, or residue. This step is often overlooked, but it ensures that your final tincture is safe to consume. Think of it like washing your hands before cooking—prevention is better than cure. A common mistake people make is using warm water, which can damage the delicate compounds in the herb.

**Step 3: Pat the Herb Dry with Clean Paper Towels**  
Once your herbs are clean, it’s time to dry them. Use clean paper towels to gently pat them dry—this helps prevent moisture from developing, which can lead to mold or spoilage. If you're using a fresh herb like mint or basil, you might want to lightly press it to release some of its oils. This step is especially important when making alcohol-based tinctures, as excess moisture can interfere with the extraction process.

**Step 4: Chop the Herb into Small Pieces**  
Finally, you need to chop the herb into small, uniform pieces. This increases the surface area and allows the alcohol to extract the active compounds more effectively. Use a sharp knife or herb chopper, and be careful not to bruise the herb too much. For instance, if you're using echinacea, you’ll want to keep the pieces small to ensure the tincture is potent but not overly harsh.
