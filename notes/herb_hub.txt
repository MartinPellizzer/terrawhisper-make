Perfect — stepping back is exactly the right move here.
What follows is a **very detailed, beginner-friendly, step-by-step OUTLINE**, designed so you can implement **one step at a time**, safely, cleanly, and in the correct order.

I will **not implement anything yet**.
I will **only explain what each step is, why it exists, and what HTML structure it will eventually use**, so you can come back later and say:

> “Explain Step 3 in detail”
> and we’ll zoom in.

We’ll build from **bare minimum → full Koray Semantic Topical Authority system**, using **plain HTML + CSS** only.

# MASTER ACTION PLAN

## Building Individual Medicinal Herb Pages (STA-Compliant)

---

## PHASE 0 — FOUNDATIONS (Do This Once)

These steps apply to **every herb page** and must exist before content.

---

### STEP 0.1 — Decide What a “Herb Page” Is (Conceptual)

**Goal:** Understand that every herb is an *entity*, not just an article.

You are creating:

* One HTML page = one **herbal entity**
* This entity must be:

  * Identifiable
  * Describable
  * Linkable
  * Comparable

**STA concept involved:**
👉 Entity recognition & consistency

No HTML yet — this is mental framing.

---

### STEP 0.2 — Create a Reusable Page Skeleton (HTML Boilerplate)

**Goal:** One base HTML file structure reused for all herbs.

This ensures:

* Consistent semantics
* Consistent crawl patterns
* Predictable indexing

**Core tags you will use (later):**

* `<!DOCTYPE html>`
* `<html lang="en">`
* `<head>`
* `<body>`
* `<main>`

No content yet — just structure.

---

### STEP 0.3 — Define Semantic Section Order (Very Important)

**Goal:** Lock the order of sections so Google learns your pattern.

STA principle:

> Consistency improves semantic confidence.

You will **never change this order** between herb pages.

Planned top-level layout:

```html
<body>
  <header></header>
  <main>
    <article>
      <!-- sections go here -->
    </article>
  </main>
  <footer></footer>
</body>
```

---

## PHASE 1 — BARE MINIMUM INDEXABLE HERB PAGE

This phase gets you **indexed correctly** with almost no content.

---

### STEP 1 — Page Identity & Primary Entity Definition

**Goal:** Tell search engines *exactly* what this page is about.

**STA concept:**
👉 Entity disambiguation

**HTML elements involved:**

* `<title>`
* `<meta name="description">`
* `<h1>`

This step answers:

* What is the herb called?
* Is this page about a plant, medicine, or product?

No secondary content yet.

---

### STEP 2 — Hero Section (Entity Summary)

**Goal:** Provide a concise, entity-rich summary.

This is **mandatory for STA**.

**HTML structure (conceptual):**

```html
<section id="overview">
  <h1></h1>
  <p></p>
</section>
```

**What this section represents:**

* Canonical definition of the herb
* Synonyms & scientific name
* Broad traditional context

**Why this matters:**

* Google uses this to understand entity meaning
* Users decide in 3 seconds if they trust you

---

### STEP 3 — Quick Facts (Entity Attributes)

**Goal:** Attach structured attributes to the entity.

**STA concept:**
👉 Attribute enrichment

**HTML elements involved:**

* `<section>`
* `<dl>`, `<dt>`, `<dd>` (VERY important)

This is your first **machine-readable semantic structure**.

---

## PHASE 2 — BASIC SEMANTIC DEPTH (Still Minimal)

Now we expand meaning without going deep.

---

### STEP 4 — Botanical Identity Section

**Goal:** Define the herb as a biological organism.

**STA concept:**
👉 Entity grounding (taxonomy)

**HTML elements involved:**

* `<section>`
* `<h2>`
* `<p>`
* `<ul>`

This tells Google:

* This is a plant
* It belongs to a family/genus
* It exists in the real world

---

### STEP 5 — Traditional Use Context

**Goal:** Establish historical legitimacy.

**STA concept:**
👉 Contextual authority

**HTML structure:**

```html
<section>
  <h2>Traditional Uses</h2>
  <article></article>
  <article></article>
</section>
```

Each tradition can later become its own **semantic sub-entity**.

---

## PHASE 3 — MEDICINAL MEANING (CORE VALUE)

This is where topical authority begins.

---

### STEP 6 — Medicinal Actions (Semantic Nodes)

**Goal:** Connect this herb to other herbs via shared actions.

**STA concept:**
👉 Semantic relationships

**HTML elements involved:**

* `<section>`
* `<h2>`
* `<h3>` (one per action)
* `<p>`

Each action:

* Nervine
* Anti-inflammatory
* Digestive tonic
  becomes a **linkable semantic node** later.

---

### STEP 7 — Active Compounds (Chemical Entity Layer)

**Goal:** Add scientific depth without making claims.

**STA concept:**
👉 Multi-layer entity modeling

**HTML elements:**

* `<section>`
* `<table>` (very important later)
* `<caption>`

This signals:

* Scientific awareness
* Non-blog informational intent

---

## PHASE 4 — TRUST & SAFETY (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

This protects rankings long-term.

---

### STEP 8 — Modern Research Overview

**Goal:** Show awareness of evidence without overclaiming.

**STA concept:**
👉 Epistemic humility (huge ranking factor)

**HTML elements:**

* `<section>`
* `<p>`
* `<ul>`

This section explicitly limits certainty.

---

### STEP 9 — Safety & Contraindications

**Goal:** Avoid YMYL penalties.

**STA concept:**
👉 Risk acknowledgment

**HTML structure:**

```html
<section>
  <h2>Safety & Precautions</h2>
  <h3>General Safety</h3>
  <h3>Contraindications</h3>
</section>
```

---

## PHASE 5 — PRACTICAL INTENT (USER VALUE)

---

### STEP 10 — Preparation & Usage Methods

**Goal:** Serve informational intent safely.

**STA concept:**
👉 Procedural context (non-transactional)

**HTML elements:**

* `<section>`
* `<h3>` per method
* `<p>`

---

### STEP 11 — Growing, Harvesting & Storage

**Goal:** Capture long-tail & enthusiast queries.

**STA concept:**
👉 Peripheral semantic expansion

Optional at first — can be added later.

---

## PHASE 6 — INTERNAL SEMANTIC NETWORK (AUTHORITY ENGINE)

This is where STA really activates.

---

### STEP 12 — Related Herbs & Semantic Links

**Goal:** Build lateral topical authority.

**STA concept:**
👉 Semantic density

**HTML elements:**

* `<nav>`
* `<ul>`
* `<a>`

Links are grouped by:

* Similar actions
* Same plant family
* Shared compounds

---

### STEP 13 — FAQ Section (Query Matching)

**Goal:** Match real user questions.

**STA concept:**
👉 Query-entity alignment

**HTML elements:**

* `<section>`
* `<details>`
* `<summary>`

Excellent for plain HTML.

---

## PHASE 7 — STANDARDIZATION & SCALE

---

### STEP 14 — Medical Disclaimer

**Goal:** Legal + trust baseline.

**STA concept:**
👉 Institutional tone consistency

Single reusable block across all pages.

---

### STEP 15 — CSS Layout & Visual Hierarchy

**Goal:** Reinforce semantic hierarchy visually.

**STA concept:**
👉 UX reinforces meaning

HTML stays semantic; CSS handles:

* Section spacing
* Heading hierarchy
* Fact box layout

---

### STEP 16 — Replication System

**Goal:** Turn one page into 100,000+ pages.

**STA concept:**
👉 Programmatic consistency

At this stage:

* You duplicate structure
* Only data changes
* Meaning stays stable

---

## FINAL NOTE (Very Important)

This plan is intentionally **slow, layered, and conservative**.

Koray’s framework rewards:

* Patience
* Consistency
* Semantic discipline

Not volume.

---

### How we proceed next (your choice)

In your next prompt, you can say **one** of these:

* “Explain Step 1 in full detail”
* “Let’s implement Step 2 with correct HTML”
* “Explain why `<dl>` matters for STA”
* “Show me the exact HTML layout for the hero section”

We’ll build this **one brick at a time**, the right way 🌱
