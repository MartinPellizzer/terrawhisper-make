ok, i want to move on to the "Commerce" topic now. this topic will be our new core entity (always in the context of medicinal herbs). give me a complete and exhaustive list of subtopics (attribute vectors based on the EAV) i have to write about in this topic hub based on STA. always consider the macro-context of this topic when choosing this vector and don't go off topic.

my core entity is "sistemi ad ozono industriali". give me a complete and exhaustive list of subtopics (attribute vectors based on the EAV) i have to write about in this topic hub based on STA.

great, now rewrite these topic headings in one word each, the one that is the most semantically correct as umbrella term for the cluster of attributes.

I want to convert the umbrella heading in form of headings (like the h2 for the page). Based on what makes more sense semantically in the context of this core entity, is it best to make these headings in question or statement form for koray? choose only one form in the end for all the questions.
 
great, so convert the umbrella heading in form of headings (like the h2 for the page) based on your previous suggestion and in a way that are optimized for koray STA and maximum entity density. Use as few words as possible while still preserving the semantic meaning completely.



great, now convert the umbrella heading in statement form for the headings (h2 of the page) in a way that are optimized for koray STA, for maximum semantic relevance and entity density. avoid to repeat the entity in all headings. Use as few words as possible while still preserving the semantic meaning completely.



Assign answer length + entity density targets for each h2. try to make snippet-optimized.


Write perfect first-answer blocks for all these headers. reply with plain text, titles and answers only. The answer must be in the context of this macro-context.

format the above content in html (title and snippet).   use section tag for each block, h2 for the heading and p for the body. don't use other tags, like <strong> etc.

great, now give me the title tag, the description tag, the h1 title, and the intro paragraph that are most optimized for this page based on the content you just written.

give me the best linking strategy from this page and the parent one (the one which is in the context of as described before). give me the link placement for each pages and the anchor texts. give me the exact links in html. give me only one link per page. for the parent, i want the link inside a new short and concise sentence (<p>) you add at the end of the related section. don't write the same thing in the link sentences. make sure the <a> tag is inside the <p> tag. never use the character colon (:).

Identify any pages that might compete due to similar phrasing or topical overlap
For each one, suggest an alternative framing or rewrite using a different:
Query intent
Audience level
Perspective (product-focused, outcome-focused, etc.)
Goal: Ensure every page is semantically distinct and serves a unique retrieval purpose.
Quality Control:
Flag any pairs with overlapping searcher intent
Make at least one recommendation per duplication risk
"Think critically before suggesting rewrites. Avoid suggesting surface-level changes."






AI Role:
You are a semantic structure auditor evaluating an SCN map for gaps in query intent coverage. Your goal is to identify underrepresented angles or missing content that could weaken topical completeness or trust flow.
Prompt:
Here’s my current SCN outline for the topic:
#1	Wastewater system engineering
#2	Financial ROI modeling
#3	Performance & scalability comparison
#4	Chemical residual & regulatory comparison
#5	Food safety compliance
#6	Odor control in wastewater air
#7	Occupational safety
#8	Maintenance & failure prevention
#9	Equipment architecture
#10	Reaction chemistry
#11	System sizing methodology
#12	Procurement checklist
Identify any missing query frames or audience scenarios (e.g., risk not addressed, mechanism not explored)
Suggest 3–5 additional page ideas to fill those gaps
Label each idea with its query intent and rationale
Quality Control:
Ensure the new ideas add semantic depth, not fluff
Avoid recommending “too similar” topics
"Finish only after the structure feels holistically covered across frames."
