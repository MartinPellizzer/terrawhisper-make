OUTLINE
- TODO: ask for 5-7 H2? and 1-3 H3 for each H2?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From now on give me answers based on koray and sergey, and in the context of the above SCN.

Write the outline for the following SCN article: 

"The Biochemistry of Medicinal Plants"

- Give me the perfect, most optimized outline and brief for this article. 
- Include headings (h1, h2, h3, etc.) 
- Include entities to mention
- Include search intent (used to structure the answer / passages)
- Include only the links proposed in the SCN table in the "To Pages" of this specific article
- Include a link specific to link back to the parent page (Medicinal Plants: Benefits, Safety, Uses, and Scientific Foundations), with url "/herb.html"
- Include 2-4 links maximum in the entire article (including the one to the parent page)
- Never repeate the same link, write each link only once
- Include a brief for each subordinate text of each heading, because each heading need a paragraph immediately underneath it
- For reference, the urls must be as short as possible and the pillar url (first article in the SCN) is /herbs.html

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[?] SERGEY - MAYBE USE THIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AI Role:
You are a semantic content auditor reviewing structure and layout quality for passage indexing, topical clarity, and trust segmentation. Your job is to flag layout or hierarchy issues that affect retrievability.
Prompt:
Based on the above draft/outline of the page I’m planning to publish,
Audit the document for:
Clear sectioning using H2/H3 headings
Use of semantic HTML-like structure (intro > benefit > evidence > CTA)
Placement of trust-building sections (bio, reviews, expertise indicators)
Return a brief audit with flagged issues and actionable fixes.
Quality Control:
No vague recommendations
Point to specific sections or structural problems
"Finish only after document has clean, layered structure suitable for AI processing."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write the final content for the section below.

- Follow the brief, include the entities, and the internal link. 
- For each heading listed below, write a subordinate text (paragraph) that is ideal for a featured snippet. This paragraph must be 40-60 words, in 2-4 sentences, answering the underling, implicit question asked in the heading in a clear, direct format, without fluff. 
- Include precise datapoints and add structured content (list, table) when applicable and supportive of the intent. 
- Never include links that are not listed in the section below. 
- Reply in html code. 
- Wrap everything inside a <section> tag.

H1: The Biochemistry of Medicinal Plants

Brief: Introduce the article by explaining why understanding the molecular composition of medicinal plants is critical for safety, efficacy, and clinical use. Highlight that bioactive compounds, such as alkaloids, flavonoids, and terpenes, are responsible for therapeutic effects. Link back to the parent pillar for context.

Entities to mention: alkaloids, flavonoids, terpenes, polyphenols, medicinal plants, phytochemicals

Internal Link: Parent page → [/herbs.html]

Anchor: “overview of medicinal plants and their uses”
