OUTLINE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From now on give me answers based on koray and sergey, and in the context of the above SCN.

Write the outline for the following SCN article: 

"Herbal Teas, Tinctures, or Capsules?"

- Give me the perfect, most optimized outline and brief for this article. 
- Include headings (h1, h2, h3, etc.) 
- Include 5-7 h2, and 1-3 h3 for each h2
- Include entities to mention
- Include main search intent and the search intents for each section (used to structure the answer / passages)
- Include only the links proposed in the SCN table in the "To Pages" of this specific article, and a specific link to link back to the parent page (Guida completa ai sistemi di ozonizzazione industriale), with url "/herbs.html"
- Include 2-4 links maximum in the entire article (including the one to the parent page)
- The urls must be as short as possible
- Never repeat the same link, write each link only once
- Include a brief for each subordinate text answer of each heading, because each heading need a paragraph immediately underneath it

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[?] SERGEY - MAYBE USE THIS

AI Role:
You are a semantic content auditor reviewing structure and layout quality for passage indexing, topical clarity, and trust segmentation. Your job is to flag layout or hierarchy issues that affect retrievability.
Prompt:
Based on the above draft/outline of the page I’m planning to publish,
Audit the document for:
Clear sectioning using H2/H3 headings
Use of semantic HTML-like structure (intro > benefit > evidence > CTA)
Placement of trust-building sections (bio, reviews, expertise indicators)
Return a brief audit with flagged issues and actionable fixes.
Quality Control:
No vague recommendations
Point to specific sections or structural problems
"Finish only after document has clean, layered structure suitable for AI processing."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write the final content for the section below.

- Follow the brief, include the entities, and the internal link. 
- For each heading listed below, write a subordinate text (paragraph) that is ideal for a featured snippet. This paragraph must be 40-60 words, in 2-4 sentences, answering the underling, implicit question asked in the heading in a clear, direct format, without fluff. 
- Include precise datapoints and add structured content (list, table) when applicable and supportive of the intent. 
- Never include links that are not listed in the section below. 
- Reply in html code. 
- Wrap everything inside a <section> tag.

H1: The Biochemistry of Medicinal Plants

Brief: Introduce the article by explaining why understanding the molecular composition of medicinal plants is critical for safety, efficacy, and clinical use. Highlight that bioactive compounds, such as alkaloids, flavonoids, and terpenes, are responsible for therapeutic effects. Link back to the parent pillar for context.

Entities to mention: alkaloids, flavonoids, terpenes, polyphenols, medicinal plants, phytochemicals

Internal Link: Parent page → [/herbs.html]

Anchor: “overview of medicinal plants and their uses”

WRITE FULL ARTICLE (ONE SHOT)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write the final content for the above outline.

- For each passage, follow the brief, include the entities, and the internal link. 
- For each heading, write a subordinate text (paragraph) that is optimized for a featured snippet, in about 40-60 words, in about 2-4 sentences, answering the underling, implicit question asked in the heading in the most clear, direct, precise format, and without fluff. 
- Include precise numbers, datapoints, and structured-type content (like list, table) when applicable and supportive of the intent of the specific heading. 
- Never include links that are not listed in the section below. 
- Wrap every section inside a <section> tag.
