From now on give me answers based on koray and sergey, and in the context of the above SCN.

Write the outline for the following SCN article: 

"Herbal Teas, Tinctures, or Capsules?"

- Give me the perfect, most optimized outline and brief for this article. 
- Include headings (h1, h2, h3, etc.) 
- Include 5-7 h2, and 1-3 h3 for each h2
- Include entities to mention
- Include main search intent and the search intents for each section (used to structure the answer / passages)
- Include only the links proposed in the SCN table in the "To Pages" of this specific article, and a specific link to link back to the parent page (Guida completa ai sistemi di ozonizzazione industriale), with url "/herbs.html"
- Include 2-4 links maximum in the entire article (including the one to the parent page)
- The urls must be as short as possible
- Never repeat the same link, write each link only once
- Include a brief for each subordinate text answer of each heading, because each heading need a paragraph immediately underneath it

Audit the document for:
Clear sectioning using H2/H3 headings
Use of semantic HTML-like structure (intro > benefit > evidence > CTA)
Placement of trust-building sections (bio, reviews, expertise indicators)
Return a brief audit with flagged issues and actionable fixes.
Quality Control:
No vague recommendations
Point to specific sections or structural problems
"Finish only after document has clean, layered structure suitable for AI processing."

💡 **Semantic SEO Note:**
For this entity to be **self-standing in a content network**, at least the following must be explicitly present in your content:

1. **Classification of compounds** (Alkaloids, Flavonoids, etc.)
2. **Key attributes** (biological or pharmacological properties)
3. **Source/context** (plant part, species, extraction)
4. **Representative examples** (specific compounds with known effects)

Optional but strong: chemical structure, mechanism of action, and interactions—these enrich **microsemantics** and increase retrieval relevance.
