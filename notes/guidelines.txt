SEMANTIC TOPICAL AUTHORITY
========================================

Teach the search engine everything about a topic, in the way it expects to learn it

========================================
METHODOLOGY
========================================
Step 0: Lock the Core Entity
Step 1: Define the Entity Like a Machine Would
Step 2: Extract Entity Attributes
Step 3: Identify Functional Relationships
Step 4: Map Comparisons & Alternatives
Step 5: Add Problems, Limitations & Risks
Step 6: Layer Search Intent Vertically
Step 7: Organize the Hierarchy
Step 8: Validate with SERPs
Step 9: Content Creation Order
Step 10: Prune Before You Publish


========================================
AI
========================================

GOLDEN RULE: Humans design the knowledge system. AI fills it.

If AI decides what to write, you've already broken the methodology.

PHASE 1: Human-designed topical framework
1. Define the core entity precisely
2. Build a semantic topical map

PHASE 2: Page-level intent locking

PHASE 3: Controlled AI drafting
1. Enforce consistent entity language
2. Control verbosity and uncertainty

PHASE 4: Internal linking done after content exists

PHASE 5: AI-assissted semantic audits
1. Detect overlap and cannibalization
2. Identify missing subtopics
