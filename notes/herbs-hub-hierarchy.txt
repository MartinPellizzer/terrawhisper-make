Perfect — this is exactly the *right* next question in Koray’s framework 👌
I’ll be decisive here, not “it depends”.

Below is a **clear page vs section separation**, based on **entity weight, intent isolation, crawl demand, and semantic independence**.

Think in terms of **explainability thresholds**:

* **Sections** = attributes that *define* the entity
* **Pages** = attributes that *expand* into their own entity clusters

---

# Topic Hub Structure

**Core Page:** `/medicinal-herbs/`
(Entity definition + attribute overview)

---

## MUST BE **SECTIONS** on the Core Hub Page

These are **foundational attributes**.
They explain *what medicinal herbs are* but don’t need to rank independently.

### 1. Definition & Identity

* What are medicinal herbs?
* Medicinal vs culinary herbs
* Medicinal herbs vs drugs
* Medicinal herbs vs supplements

Reason:

> These are **entity-identifying attributes**, not destinations.

---

### 2. Origin & Source Overview

* Botanical origin
* Plant parts used
* Wild vs cultivated (brief)
* Geographic origin (high-level)

Reason:

> Source attributes support understanding but don’t require deep isolation *at hub level*.

---

### 3. Classification Overview

* Botanical classification (summary)
* Therapeutic classification (summary)
* Traditional system classification (summary)

Reason:

> Classification is necessary **context**, but each classification system becomes pages.

---

### 4. Active Compounds (High-Level)

* What “active compounds” are
* Why they matter
* Examples (alkaloids, flavonoids, etc.)

Reason:

> The hub explains *that* they exist — not full chemistry.

---

### 5. Mechanism of Action (Conceptual)

* How herbs interact with the body (overview)
* Difference vs pharmaceuticals

Reason:

> Mechanism is **explanatory**, not exhaustive here.

---

### 6. Preparation Forms (Overview)

* Teas, tinctures, extracts, etc. (list + short explanations)

Reason:

> This primes users for deeper pages without intent mixing.

---

### 7. General Safety Overview

* “Natural ≠ safe”
* Importance of dosage
* High-level risk awareness

Reason:

> Trust signal + dependency setup for safety pages.

---

### 8. Cultural & Historical Context (Brief)

* Historical use
* Role in traditional medicine

Reason:

> Contextual, not navigational.

---

### 9. Limitations & Misconceptions

* What herbs can’t do
* Common myths

Reason:

> Boundary-setting belongs on the hub.

---

## MUST BE **SEPARATE PAGES** (Child Hubs / Pillars)

These are **semantically heavy**, intent-rich, and expandable into clusters.

---

## 1. Classification Pages (High Priority)

Each becomes a **taxonomy hub**.

* Medicinal herbs by therapeutic function
* Medicinal herbs by body system
* Medicinal herbs by plant family
* Medicinal herbs in Ayurveda
* Medicinal herbs in Traditional Chinese Medicine
* Medicinal herbs in Western herbalism

Why pages:

> Each classification creates **dozens of child entities** (individual herbs).

---

## 2. Preparation & Forms Pages

* Herbal teas and infusions
* Decoctions
* Tinctures
* Extracts
* Powders
* Capsules
* Topical herbal preparations
* Essential oils vs whole-herb preparations

Why pages:

> Preparation = **procedural + experiential intent**.

---

## 3. Dosage & Administration Page

* Dosage principles
* Frequency
* Duration
* Individualized dosing

Why page:

> High-risk topic + strong informational intent → isolation required.

---

## 4. Therapeutic Uses Page

* Conditions treated with medicinal herbs
* Preventive vs supportive use
* Evidence-based applications

Why page:

> This is a **gateway hub** to condition-level clusters.

---

## 5. Safety, Side Effects & Interactions Page

* Side effects
* Toxic herbs
* Contraindications
* Drug interactions
* Pregnancy & children

Why page:

> Safety deserves **maximum clarity and crawl priority**.

---

## 6. Quality, Purity & Standards Page

* Quality indicators
* Adulteration
* Contaminants
* Testing & certifications
* Storage & shelf life

Why page:

> Commercial + trust intent lives here.

---

## 7. Evidence & Research Page

* Scientific studies
* Clinical trials
* Traditional vs modern evidence
* Research limitations

Why page:

> Supports **algorithmic trust + human skepticism**.

---

## 8. Legal & Regulatory Page

* Legal status by region
* FDA / EU regulations
* Labeling rules

Why page:

> Jurisdictional complexity = standalone entity.

---

## 9. Comparison Pages

(These can be one page or split later)

* Medicinal herbs vs supplements
* Medicinal herbs vs pharmaceuticals
* Whole herbs vs isolated compounds

Why pages:

> Comparative intent is **distinct** and shouldn’t dilute the hub.

---

## 10. Future & Research Trends Page

* Innovation
* Integration with healthcare
* Sustainability challenges

Why page:

> Forward-looking informational intent + topical freshness.

## Koray-style rule of thumb (use this forever)

> **If a subtopic can spawn 5+ child entities or satisfy a distinct intent, it must be a page.**
> **If it explains the core entity itself, it stays a section.**

If you want next, I can:

* Define **internal linking rules** (anchor logic)
* Help you **write the hub outline**
* Decide **publishing order**
* Or design **individual herb page templates**

You’re building this the *right* way 🌿
