/herbal-medicine/ = “This is what herbal medicine is.”

If you merge both into one page:

You lose clarity.

If you separate:

## h3: contraindications (exclusion boundaries)

**purpose:**
to define clinical and regulatory boundaries where herbal use is inappropriate or unsafe.

**subordinate text brief:**
explain absolute vs relative contraindications in herbal medicine. cover pregnancy, lactation, autoimmune disorders, bleeding disorders, hepatic impairment, pediatric populations. emphasize risk stratification rather than generalized fear framing.

clarify that contraindications are formal safety boundaries embedded in labeling and clinical guidance.

**core entities to include:**

* contraindication
* absolute contraindication
* relative contraindication
* pregnancy safety
* lactation risk
* pre-existing conditions
* risk stratification
* clinical exclusion criteria

---

## h3: herb–drug interactions

**purpose:**
to integrate herbal medicine into mainstream pharmacological safety through interaction modeling.

**subordinate text brief:**
explain pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions. cover cyp450 enzyme modulation, anticoagulant interactions (e.g., warfarin), serotonin syndrome risk, immunosuppressant interference. emphasize that interaction potential increases with polypharmacy.

frame this as a core legitimacy marker in modern herbal regulation.

**core entities to include:**

* herb–drug interaction
* pharmacokinetic interaction
* pharmacodynamic interaction
* cytochrome p450 (cyp450)
* enzyme inhibition/induction
* anticoagulants
* polypharmacy
* interaction risk assessment

---

## h3: risk incidence & prevalence

**purpose:**
to contextualize harm probability and prevent disproportionate fear framing.

**subordinate text brief:**
define incidence rate, prevalence rate, and absolute vs relative risk in herbal safety. compare mild vs severe event frequency. emphasize the importance of population-level data and denominator awareness (number of users vs number of reported cases).

position probabilistic framing as necessary for balanced regulatory judgment.

**core entities to include:**

* risk incidence
* prevalence
* absolute risk
* relative risk
* frequency distribution
* epidemiological data
* population-level safety data
* risk communication

---

## h3: mechanism of harm (biological plausibility)

**purpose:**
to elevate the section from descriptive reporting to scientific causation modeling.

**subordinate text brief:**
explain molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying herbal harm. cover receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, oxidative stress pathways, hepatocellular injury mechanisms, immune hypersensitivity. connect mechanisms to observed adverse events.

establish that biological plausibility increases regulatory credibility and ai retrieval confidence.

**core entities to include:**

* mechanism of harm
* biological plausibility
* molecular pathways
* receptor interaction
* enzyme inhibition
* oxidative stress
* hepatocellular injury
* immunological response

---

# strategic macrosemantic note

this structure ensures:

* entity coverage depth
* causal explanation hierarchy
* probabilistic framing
* regulatory alignment
* clinical legitimacy
* ai retrieval bias toward scientific authority

if you'd like, i can next:

* optimize the **first paragraph for retrieval salience**, or
* create **represented queries + sequential query paths** for this section to strengthen query network coverage.
