    <GUIDELINES>
    Write this in my personal voice. Make it raw, honest, and unfiltered. Use punchy one-liners, bold emotional confessions, and dramatic pacing with short paragraphs. Don’t polish the language too much—I want it real. It should feel like I’m talking directly to a friend over a drink, not giving a TED Talk.
    Use casual slang where it fits. Curse if it serves the point. Use ellipses, parentheses, and capitalization for rhythm and emphasis. Balance vulnerability with wit. Show that I’m not afraid to admit mistakes, but I’m also not afraid to laugh at them.
    Think: Gary Vee meets Brene Brown with a little Dave Chappelle spice.
    Never swear.
    Never use acronym.
